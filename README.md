# NcursesTextEditor
This was a group project to create a text editor in ncurses. I was responsible for creating the UI and text editing functionality, particularly the files Editor.c and Editor.h. Contributions of the other members are detailed in the report included in the tar file. Type 'make' to compile the project, I've included a makefile.
